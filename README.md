# Lipschitz Observer Design For A Nonlinear System

This project is a solution to one of the questions in my fault detection and control course midterm. The simulation file which is done in Simulink is Midterm_Q4_sim.slx however it needs the Midterm_Q4.m MATLAB file to run for some declared parameters.

In this project a rather brilliant observer called Thau observer or Lipschitz observer is proposed and designed to estimate the states of a special form of nonlinear systems. All the details regarding the observer design and its simulation are given in "Kian Khaneghahi - Fault Midterm - Q4.pdf" report file.
